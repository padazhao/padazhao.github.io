            <h3>Blockchain Driven Data Trading for AI Training Dataset (Master's Thesis)
            </h3>
            <p>Data trading is executed based on smart contracts written in Solidity on Ethereum.
                Encrypted AI training dataset is uploaded through IPFS,
                and then the blockchain is used to list and trade data. For dispute arbitration in transactions,
                a data arbitration Agent is established through the large language model
                ChatGPT and Google Bard to verify data. The similarity between data description and data
                content is automatically judged to ensure reliable arbitration
                results are given back to the blockchain smart contract.

            <h3>Master Admission System
            </h3>
            <p>The architecture design of the master's admissions system follows the standard three-tier architecture
                model, including the presentation layer, service layer, and persistence layer. It uses SpringBoot as
                the framework, Hibernate as the object-relational mapping (ORM), and Thymeleaf as the template engine.
                The system follows the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, which is used to organize code in a way that
                separates concerns and improves maintainability and extensibility. The view component uses Thymeleaf as
                the template engine to render HTML pages. The controller component handles HTTP requests and maps them
                to the corresponding controllers and methods. The controller layer handles user requests and RESTful
                endpoints to accept and process client requests. It sends requests to the corresponding services for
                processing and coordinates the flow of business logic. The RestController class is also responsible
                for returning the response to the view after processing is completed. </p>

            <h3>Classification of Biochip Data from Video Captures
                of Changing Spot Values (Bachelor Thesis)

            </h3>
            <p>By building an Android application on the mobile terminal,
                a video of the antibiotics in biological experiments changing
                over time is placed in it. The application then slices the video
                into several frames of pictures, and then calculates the RGB values
                in each well plate through image recognition. The average RGB value in
                each well plate represents the well plate, and then uses a machine learning
                classification algorithm to summarize the changes in the color point values
                in the well plate to classify the types of antibiotics. Finally, the information
                is visualized and XAI is used to explain the logic of the final result selection process. </p>

            <h3>Time Manage Masters

            </h3>
            <p>In this project, the team designed a personal calendar that implements date viewing,
                schedule making, and convenient personal time management. According to market research,
                most Android time management applications have implemented basic calendar functions,
                including date display, holiday reminders, and some schedule templates, such as
                schedules, birthdays, anniversaries, countdowns, etc. In addition, considering the
                wide range of user needs, this project is designed for all users who use Android
                smartphones. Based on the research results, this project proposes some excellent
                features, including improved edit ability, enhanced visualization, and more customized
                services based on user choices.
